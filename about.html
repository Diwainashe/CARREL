        <p class="muted" style="margin: 10px 0 0; max-width: 70ch;">
          Carrel Kumbirai is a wildlife painter whose work celebrates Africa’s iconic species through warm, earth-toned realism.
          Each piece is built with patience, detail, and a deep respect for the landscapes and animals that inspire it.

          <!-- Keep readable paragraph spacing without adding new CSS -->
          <p class="card-meta" style="margin-top: 8px; line-height: 1.75;">
            Carrel’s paintings explore the quiet power of wildlife — the alert gaze of a leopard, the calm presence of a lion,
            or the expressive character of the painted dog. His style leans into natural earth tones to echo the feeling of
            savanna light, dust, bark, and stone.
          </p>

          <p class="card-meta" style="margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.75;">
            Many works begin with reference moments gathered through conversations and collaboration with African wildlife
            photographers. Those images become a starting point — not a shortcut — guiding anatomy, texture, and mood while
            allowing the final painting to carry its own atmosphere and story.
          </p>

          <p class="card-meta" style="margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.75;">
            Carrel also draws inspiration from local game reserves and the people who protect these habitats. From the curve
            of a horn to the pattern of a coat, the goal is always the same: to create pieces that feel alive, honest, and
            timeless — artworks that connect collectors to the wild.

          <p class="card-meta" style="margin-top: 8px; line-height: 1.75;">
            A recurring theme in Carrel’s portfolio is the African wild dog (painted dog) — one of Africa’s most captivating
            and misunderstood predators. Through portrait-style studies and conservation-focused pieces, he highlights their
            intelligence, social bonds, and unique individuality.
          </p>

          <p class="card-meta" style="margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.75;">
            The intention is simple: raise awareness through beauty. When people emotionally connect to a species, they’re
            more likely to care about its future. These works often spark conversations about habitat protection, responsible
            tourism, and the importance of preserving biodiversity.

          <p class="card-title">Exhibitions & milestones</p>

          <p class="card-meta" style="margin-top: 8px; line-height: 1.75;">
            Carrel has travelled extensively — including to Tanzania — to exhibit and sell his work, meeting collectors and
            art lovers across the region. Alongside exhibitions, his paintings have been commissioned by clients from around
            the world, with requests ranging from signature big-cat portraits to highly personal wildlife pieces.
          </p>

          <p class="card-meta" style="margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.75;">
            His creative process is strongly shaped by collaboration: working with African wildlife photographers for
            inspiration, partnering with local game reserves, and engaging with art galleries that support wildlife-focused
            storytelling. This mix of field influence and studio craft helps each painting carry authenticity — not just detail.
          </p>
